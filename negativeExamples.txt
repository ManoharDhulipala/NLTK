This class is useless and I did not learn anything. This class teaches you how to repeat verbatim of the class notes and format. Just follow the format and notes strictly and you will do fine on tests. Sometimes I would get a correct answer wrong because I did not word it exactly like class notes. Grade is also dependent on ta. So pick a good one.
The class is so pointless. It does not teach you anything about giving an actual speech.
Find out what his biases are before you write your paper, or you are screwed!
He's a funny guy and good lecturer, but his grading system is whack and you don't know how it works until it's too late to do anything about your grade. Speeches are not as important as it seems. He is not very helpful and not very easy to reach. BIG EGO!
His teaching method is giving a list of twenty sentences, having you translate them into Japanese or English, then giving you another, and another, and another list. He never actually teaches and it severly limits your ablility to think in the language. He's a great guy, but just not a good teacher.
His class is very hard. I had Genetics with him, his lectures are not good, very unorgonized in lectures. But he is willing to help you out. You have to study hard and know alot, tests are extremly hard and alittle unfair, alot of questions for the given time.
Took CALC 1 with him. He talks really fast and sometimes is kinda confusing. His tests are hard, definitely have to study hard to get an A. study tip: work through study guide and notes a bunch of times.
