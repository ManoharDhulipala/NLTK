"Fisher is the worst professor. Please do not take his class. His lectures are boring, and he goes off topic a lot. He expects you to already know the material. He made me feel terrible about assignments I worked really hard on by writing rude comments. Also, he grades very harshly. Do not waste your time and find a different professor.",Negative
I do not recommend Gary if you are bad at chem or do not have a great foundation of it.. He is not great at lectures and goes off topic to explain old stories. He doesn't tell you what you're exactly going to be tested on but he does grade leniently.. Just beware for not understanding a lot. He will not inform you on A LOT of important stuff..,Negative
Gary is awesome. He offers office hours at convenient times and sees the work you put into the course. He emails you a set of lecture notes and they are helpful for the exams and final.,Positive
"Very good teacher, approaches a difficult subject in a way that makes it clear and engaging. His lectures are very entertaining and he doesn't make struggling students feel bad. I strongly recommend Gary.",Positive
"He might seem intimidating the first class, but Professor Fisher is one of the nicest professors there is! I only had him for o-chem lab but his lectures in lab were interesting and he was very thorough. He is a fair grader and simply wants his students to succeed. Don't be shy, ask questions! He is willing to help you in any way he can.",Positive
"Organic chemistry is hard. His lectures are not the clearest but the class is doable if you read the book and do practice problems. If you go to office hours and sections and ask questions, you can get an A. You just have to put in some work.",Negative
A convoluted subject like organic chemistry does not deserve to be taught be such a rude and unreasonable person. Would avoid at all costs!,Negative
"Awesome Professor, he is a master in his field. Go to office hour. He gives very interesting anecdotes. If you want to kill it on the final, DO 5 ROUNDS OF THE HW!!!!!!!!!!!",Positive
"His tests are difficult because he doesn't give us a general framework of what it would look like. He doesn't even give us a practice exam. He also rarely does examples in class (which is absolutely essential, especially for something like ochem) the 20-40% average on first midterm says everything. avoid.",Negative
"Lectures are horrendous! He completely lacks clarity, goes off on tangents every other minute, and lecture notes that are more cluttered than the actual text book required for the class. The average for the first exam was 20-30% and the final was a complete curveball. I was doing fine in chemistry until he came along. Downright awful teaching.",Negative
"Completely unreasonable ochem class. First midterm average was a 20% and then is frustrated at the class rather than reflecting on his teaching methods. Second midterm, slightly more reasonable. Final? Completely foreign material. Claims to have covered it during lecture but as an attendee, it was not covered nearly enough. Avoid at all costs.",Negative
"He rambles a lot which made going to class pointless. No practice exams and expects us to follow from his printed handouts (were not that helpful). His 1st midterm was difficult and long (avg was 30%) , the 2nd was more reasonable. Final was extremely hard. Pretty much had to self-study from the book. I regret dropping this class when I could.",Negative
"He taught at UCSC for the first time and hope he never comes back. First midterm average was 20-30%, he gets mad at us and doesn't curve and didn't give us a practice midterm. Second midterm the class figured out how to study for his test, average was still a 68%. The final, he put materials that he told nobody to prepare for. He is horrible.",Negative
Class is literally useless unless you treat it like office hours and ask questions. He uses typed notes not lecture slides which are pretty useless. You're pretty much learning out of the book. First test was super hard and the second one was more reasonable. He barely gives partial credit and scolds you when you ask for it. Definitely avoid.,Negative
Amazing Professor by far the BEST Chem. professor I have ever had. Dr. Fisher really cares about his students and does not mind if they as questions. He is very helpful.,Positive
"Great teacher this one. CHEM002 was a delight. Dr. Fisher puts difficult concepts into perspective for students and he is very approachable. Advice: attend the lectures (they're priceless), read the text, practice stoichiometry, have fun!",Positive
"His is the best chemistry instructor I have ever had. He makes the topic interesting for you. Also, he is very flexible about grading.",Positive
His exams are hard.. but he will do everything he can for you to understand..so ask plenty of questions! He sells his lecture notes but those are pretty confusing to understand.. you will need to study a lot. His grading scale is extremely curved.,Positive
Very generous grading scale! You can fail your midterms and still pass: 64-55% is a C! Suggested problems are not helpful. The tests are based off his lecture notes. Each test has extra credit problems. All multiple choice. He is willing to help you if you go to his office hours. He is very nice if you ask him questions. Get to know him!,Positive
Professor Fisher is awesome! His lectures are very interesting and funny. He is always willing to help and will make sure you write perfect lab reports by the end of the quarter. His exams are pretty hard though and you need to study like crazy!,Positive
"ok he's very funny and clear and helpful,... everything you can expect from a great teacher. However you have to study to do well in exams. READ THE NOTES, just dont care about the suggested problems in the book as it wont be on the test. If you get an A before final then you wont have to take final, which is very helpful for me.",Positive
"Many ppl got tormented in his 12A/B, but not his 12C! His grading in 12C is super lenient: full points on lab final for everyone! Besides, his 12C custom labs are extremely fun and works perfect! (u dont have this kind of fun o-chem lab exp. w/ other profs! Trust me, take him!) (BTW, no one failed his 12C this yr)",Positive
"I took him a couple years ago. He seemed to have a really good understanding of chemistry and explains well, but the class is still kinda hard. I dropped it cuz he didn't tell me what I did wrong on my lab reports and kept giving me bad grades, just tells you you suck and need to pay attention pretty much. Very discouraging professor.",Negative
"Okay, let us be real. HE is hard teacher his exams are really tricky and hard no matter if u do all the book problems.going to his class is waste of time,because u can learn on Ur own better than listening to him for an HR. Lastly if u have the chance take David gray because he is the best in ochem as well as in gen chem.",Positive
"Prof. Fisher is straightforward, clear, and expects all chem students to succeed. He is a no nonsense professor, know your material prior to all lectures or you will sit there dumbfounded. Exam material, even if it is MC, can be challenging for 1B. Study both Garys course notes and the book. Special lecture topics post-exam were fun and informative",Positive
"He rocks my world although he was kinda scary in the beginning. He is EXTREMELY HELPFUL and willing to listen to your opinion about the class, about your grade, about your chosen career (and even about your chemistry nightmare). Can't wait to take Chemistry 12B with Mechzilla (alter-ego of Prof. Fisher)",Positive
"I know, I know! He's hell'a hard in Chem 12... Very picky in answers, always expect u to explain! However, I've never slept in class--a funny guy with cool chem jokes. Take him if u want to learn chem and does not care about ur GPA. I changed my major from Bio to Chem because of his Chem 1A! Nice try Gary!",Positive
"Fisher is cool. He tells a few too many stories during class, and his guitar skills are suspect, but he definitely knows his stuff when it comes to chemistry. He always answers questions, has decent office hours, and is generally a nice guy. The classes aren't easy, but this is science, not PE. Put in the work and you'll do fine.",Positive
"He makes chemistry so interesting and exciting that u just want to keep learning.TAKE HIM! He doesn't expect u to memorize a set of rules n numbers becuz thats not fair, thats just basically a test of memorization then. He stresses u to understand concepts, instead, which is how it should be in a class. u do have 2work for ur grade but its worth it",Positive
"he is ok... likes to joke in class and during lab, had a fun time with him... just study his notes and you'll be fine.",Positive
"Fisher is a great man, he always make humorous joke in his lecture, but his tests are very difficult, if u get A b4 the final,u dont need to take final. Ps: get his past paper, it will help for your grade.",Positive
